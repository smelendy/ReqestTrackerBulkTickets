# ReqestTrackerBulkTickets


We use Request tracker 4 to keep track of out operational systerm changes.. There are several ways to create a ticket however not in bulk from a spreadsheet, so I made one.

I use the python rtkit which works with Request Trackers REST 1.0 API.

it can be found at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-rtkit/
if you have pip installed just use
pip install python-rtkit

Enjoy.
